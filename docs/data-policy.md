# "Privacy Policy"
Any messages sent to this bot (tagged messages and reply chains) go through the
LLM to produce an output. Some of these messages are stored, with their
associated user ID, in order to provide context in future interactions. Outside
of that they aren't used or touched, and in fact are deleted/cleared quite
regularly (and can be cleared by the user if they send the bot a message which
says `RESET`).
